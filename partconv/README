partconv

git repo : 

the source includes the PaToH library, a simple make should produce two executables :
part and evalord.

part takes as input a graph file in the gra format (the format produced by
dynamic-graph) and outputs two files : 
- order.txt describing the ordering defined by the hierarchical partitioning
- cuts.txt describing the graph total_cuts = f(max_cuts_per_part), which gives
  a good idea of the cache efficiency.

evalord takes two arguments : the graph and the ordering produced by part, and
outputs the reuse distance graph for this ordering.
