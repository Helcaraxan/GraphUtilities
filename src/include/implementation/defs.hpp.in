 * \def AUTO_THRESHOLD
 *
 * \brief Numerical macro that defines the number necessary query-match wins to
 * set a search-method.
 *
 * When no search-method was set for reachability queries on the graph the first
 * queries are actually run with every available method in a competition. The
 * first search-method to achieve AUTO_THRESHOLD wins in these competitions is
 * set as the search-method to use for all further queries.

 * This constant is only used when ENABLE_TLS is not defined. In the case
 * ENABLE_TLS is defined there is no limit imposed on the number of parallel
 * worker threads.
